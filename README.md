# Human Skills Reflections App

This is an app to help capture student reflections for Human Skills Assessments. 

## Why?

There has been a lot of trial and error and a lot of work figuring out how we can make this experience easier and more streamline accesibilty for students first and then the Human Skills Team. As a team we have tried creating a reflections logbook using Google Docs to using google forms which feeds a seperate google spreadsheet for each cohort.

### What's included

* a sign up and log in funciton
* 

<!-- This repo includes:

* a single, simple API endpoint (`/api/v1/fruits`)
* a single React component (`<App />`)
* an example database module (`server/db/fruits.js`)
* an API client module (`client/apis/fruits.js`)
* configuration for Vitest and testing library
* configuration for server-side debugging in VS Code
* configuration for preprocessing Sass -->

#### **From the Github UI**

See the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to use Github's feature to create a new repo from a template.

#### **From the command line**

```
git clone https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/boilerplate-fullstack-query [your-project-name]
cd [your-project-name]

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the client running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
