# Human Skills Reflections App

This is an app to help capture student reflections for Human Skills Assessments. 

### Why?

There has been a lot of trial and error and a lot of work figuring out how we can make this experience easier and more streamline accesibilty for students first and then the Human Skills Team. As a team we have tried creating a reflections logbook using Google Docs to using google forms which feeds a seperate google spreadsheet for each cohort.

### What's included

* registration page for students to input details:
