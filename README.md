# Human Skills Reflections App

This is an app to help capture student reflections for Human Skills Assessments. 

### Why?

There has been a lot of trial and error and a lot of work figuring out how we can make this experience easier and more streamline and more accessible for students first and then the Human Skills Team. As a team we have tried creating a reflections logbook using Google Docs to using google forms which feeds a separate google spreadsheet for each cohort.

### What's included

### User / students
* login functionality using Auth0,
* registration page for students to input details:
  - Full-name,
  - Email,
  - Cohort,
  - Password,
* an introduction page,
* phase breakdown of Deep Dives,
* Weekly reflections pages to add, edit

### Admin
* Human Skills Team can login and will be able to access student input to pull out information for AirTable (for recording purposes),
